# WAP2
This website is designed to compare the performance of two persons on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) platform.<br>

One can also see the individual performance, the rating, number of solved and unsolved, the problems tag which he/she has covered etc. 

We aim to make the journey of competitive programming better for all our fellow coders.
